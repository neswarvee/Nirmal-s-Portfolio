        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My interest in software's ability to tackle real-world problems led me to technology. After exploring with different programming languages and frameworks, I decided to study computer science with an artificial intelligence focus at Sheffield University.
    </p>
    <p>
        Academic assignments and internships fuelled my interest in software development and AI. I liked designing machine learning models and software that analyses data and provides actionable insights. This hands-on experience has solidified my opinion that software development and AI are essential for innovative and efficient solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like building scalable software systems, optimising methods, and using AI to solve complex problems. I feel mastering these topics is crucial to making an impact in tech. I love supporting technology via continual learning and professional development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I pride myself on my relentless pursuit of innovation, love for solving difficult challenges, and dedication to creating powerful, user-friendly solutions.
